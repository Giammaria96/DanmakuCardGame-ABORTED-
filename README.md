----------

This is a **nonprofit** project, in order to create a software to specifically play the 
card game "*Danmaku !! Card game*" by *Mystery Parfait*, because at the moment, the game 
is only playable in its physical format, or Through the softwate "Table Top Simulator" 
in which only gives you a space to use the letters in a digical way, but does not 
automate the game itself.

This software is still not playable, and remain being the sole developer of the same, 
and one of the few who know the existence of this project.

I wish to generate a playable version of this card game, then present this software 
to *Mystery Parfait* and request an authorization to develop this game in a more public 
way, and thus obtain the collaboration of other **programmers**, **graphic designers** or anyone 
else who wants and can contribute to the project .

In the event that *Mystery Parfait* disapproves of my software, I will keep it for 
private use only, my desire is not to go against the objectives of the group mentioned above.

I **hereby** ask anyone who finds this project, not to divulge it in any way.
